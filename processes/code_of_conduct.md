# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct governs the environment of the DataKind community. DataKind strives to harness the power of data science in the service of humanity. We thrive because of our community and want to ensure everyone has a rewarding and fulfilling experience in line with DataKind&#39;s core values.

### Expected Behaviors

One of our favorite mottos at DataKind is &quot;**Be tough on ideas, gentle on people.**&quot; People are at the center of all that we do so it&#39;s critical that, as we strive to do excellent work, we also demonstrate mutual respect for one another and exemplify our core values in all that we do.

| **Humble** <br/> We are nothing without each other. We connect communities, and it is our mutual respect for one another that keeps us moving forward. | **Sensitive and Thoughtful** <br/>We are constantly sensitive to the fact that we are not just dealing with numbers, but that we are dealing with people&#39;s lives. | **Approachable and Fun** <br/>Whether you&#39;re a nonprofit, a data scientist, or just someone interested in learning more, we welcome you to the DataKind community and make sure you have a great experience with us. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transparent and Open** <br/> We are completely transparent in what we do, how we create our work, how we approach problems, and how we think about the world. | **Committed to Excellence** <br/> People rely on our abilities and those of our volunteers, so we only accept the best and the brightest into DataKind&#39;s staff and top ranks. We strive to continuously learn and improve. | **Committed to Diversity** <br/> We welcome diverse viewpoints, diverse skillsets, diverse backgrounds, diverse lifestyles, and seek variety and richness in our community. |

<br/>
We are committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people of all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs.

Every member of the DataKind community is expected to work hard, be considerate of their colleagues across the community, and contribute to a collaborative, positive, and healthy environment in which we can all succeed.

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Discrimination and harassment are expressly prohibited in our community. Do not make assumptions about a person&#39;s level of expertise based on their gender, race, class, sexual identity, or gender presentation. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography; inappropriate physical contact
- Use of hateful, sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, jokes, or language
- Sexist, racist, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory or derogatory language
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

Any behavior or language that is unwelcoming, would hurt someone or make them feel uncomfortable—whether or not it rises to the level of harassment—is unacceptable in our community.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers will notify that participant that their behavior has been reported and may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender and/or expulsion from the community itself.

This Code of Conduct **applies to everyone** - be it DataKind Chapter Leaders, the Core Team, the Sprint Task Force, Data Ambassadors, Data Experts, Project Managers, Volunteers, Nonprofit Partners, Speakers, Media persons or any other attendees. It also applies to all the spaces managed by DataKind Bangalore which includes event venues, Slack, and any other forums created by the project teams which the community uses for communication.
